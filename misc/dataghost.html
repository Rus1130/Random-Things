    <div id="in" style="display:none">They had gotten the fishy smell very nearly correct, so he'd have to send his regards to the engineers._Fish, mud, and the stale metallic aftertaste that recycled station air always seemed to leave in his mouth._The grass, too, was just right. Springy. Damp. A little gross. The entire holographic expanse was well done, as close as he could possibly get to home, here on the station._The final test, of course, to see if he'd wasted his money or not, was waiting just across the gravel road. He didn't want to go in.~No, that wasn't right. He ^did want to go in, and he dreaded it._^It was a house, single story propped up on stilts to accommodate floods and old to enough to show the wear and tear of more than a few tropical storms. _The real deal was probably in even worse shape now, with no one around to take care of it. To repair it when it broke._With a sigh, he lifted himself from patch of dirt that he sat on, crossing the road in a few confident strides. _As a child, he'd run up to the house barefoot, and taken flying leaps over the ditches instead of trudging up the hot, pebbly driveway._Now, many years and many millions of miles away from then, he winces at the crunch of his work boots against the ground. _The house looms before him, though he knows it to only be large enough to house three comfortably, and four or five in a pinch. _The storm door opens easily, freshly oiled despite its appearance._He'll have to get that fixed._The wooden inner door has flaking paint on it, pale green and hand carved. It's old, but it withstands his two short knocks.~The porch swing was empty.~Light footsteps can be heard on the other side of the door, and it opens, slowly._And there she is. He's looking over her, professional for a brief moment, checking everything off the list._Hair, eyes, hands, mouth...the rest. Neither of them has spoken for a few moments now._They'd made sure she knew—had ^programmed this to be updated on the situation._On the reasoning. So, she—it was aware that it was a hologram._It was aware of why. He doesn't care much, not right now, because it's ^her. She's ^here.~He stands still, frozen in place as she steps forward, running her hands over the pips on his shoulders, the patch on his arm, and he realizes, belatedly, that he is still wearing his current uniform._Since it had happened, he'd been—~"Promoted. That's commander, right? Good for you.” She says it softly, so soft that its barely audible above the night sounds of the swamp._It still sends a shiver straight through his heart. “Still doing lab work?”~“Chief technical officer now. I've been...mostly training field officers and research crews,” he says, and now he's letting her lead him further into the house.~“My crews?”~“No. The captain has put the dig on hold due to the circumstances. It’s just lab work for the foreseeable future, until proper security can be set up. No more accidents.”~She's sitting on the kitchen counter, the same corner as always, stirring a cup of something hot and smiling at him in a way that doesn't quite reach her eyes._He's not sure how a hologram can achieve that. It's a bit unnerving.~“You did marry an archaeologist. Accidents are bound to happen. And—” her gaze narrows. “—I wouldn't have closed down the whole dig just for one person.”~“You weren't exactly in a position to have an opinion.” He stands near the kitchen door, not caring if its awkward. He can't quite stomach the couch just yet.~“Oh, I know. I know. Still.”~“Captain Hayes wasn't doing it for you, they were doing it for me. For your coworkers and cadets. After you—their safety is more important than uncovering artefacts.”~This was meant to be relaxing. Or at least closure, like one of the ensigns had said. They shouldn't be fighting; he didn't ^want to fight._For god's sake, this was his ^wife. He wouldn't get this anywhere else, not anymore.~“If you're going to cry, do it over here so I can hold you.“ She sounds further away, and he realizes that she's gone to sit on the couch before he realizes he's looking at her through tears._His vision is blurry, getting worse by the second as he transitions from silent sobbing to outright bawling._He knows the walk there by heart, by soul. So, sight is made irrelevant._Finally, ^finally, he curls up on the cushions beside her, practically melting into the rough linen like it was silk stuffed with eiderdown._He hadn't meant to, but by habit he'd slipped into his old spot. A long, long time ago, before he'd lived there officially, he'd eaten afterschool snacks there and done homework._They'd make a game out of flying the multiplication sheets turned airplanes from the far end of the couch to their backpacks by the door,_and whoever won would have to be chased by the other, in circles around the house, in and out of bedrooms, until either one submitted,_or the both of them were kicked outside to burn off that energy._They would play under the house even, but never for long; he'd always chicken out at the idea of snakes._The couch smelled the same, oh god, it smelled like ^her. He never wanted to see another engineer again.~Pear trees and rainwater drowned out the dusty ozone of the station, and the salt from his tears stung tiny cuts on his face, grounding him briefly in the unreality._He allows himself to be held while the tears subside.~“I haven't been back since. To our quarters.” Even though he's still clinging to her lap, he can feel her looking down at him._A hand brushes through his curls, lingering around the shell of his ear.~“And how long has it been, exactly?”~Of course she would ask that, of course._How could he expect anything less, when he spent most of his childhood coming to this very house to get a good night's sleep,_when he had spent his teen years setting up tents in her backyard,_when he had been a young adult scrambling down the side of his cadet building to seek solace in hers, where it was quiet?_Where it was safe.~“A week and a day. And a couple of hours.”~“Have you been sleeping in the lab?”~He doesn't answer that.~«The wind outside has begun to pick up, and the frogs have gotten louder.~Written by reijnders¶</div>
