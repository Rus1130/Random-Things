Heap: Variables that are first created are automatically put into the heap. They cannot be read or written to.
Callstack: Variables can be moved into the callstack so they can be modified.

Structure of variables:
{name: "variable_name", value: "variable_value"}

Defining variables:
# variable_name variable_value

-----

logging variables:
log variable_name

Searches the callstack for the variable and outputs it to the application console.

-----

pulling variables:
pull variable_name

Moves a variable from the heap to the callstack.

-----

pushing variables:
push variable_name

Moves a variable from the callstack to the heap.
