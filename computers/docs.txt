Heap: Variables that are first created are automatically put into the heap. They cannot be read or written to.
Callstack: Variables can be moved into the callstack so they can be modified.

Structure of variables:
{name: "variable_name", value: "variable_value"}

Defining variables:
assign variable_name to variable_value

Creates a variable with the name of "variable_name" and value of "variable_value".

-----

logging variables:
log variable_name

Searches the callstack for the variable "variable_name" and outputs it to the application console.

-----

pulling variables:
pull variable_name

Moves the variable "variable_name" from the heap to the callstack.

-----

pushing variables:
push variable_name

Moves the variable "variable_name" from the callstack to the heap.

-----

dropping variables:
drop variable_name

Removes the variable "variable_name" from the callstack and the heap.

-----

overwriting variables:
owrite variable_name to variabe_value

Overwrites the specified "variable_name" value with "variable_value".

-----
