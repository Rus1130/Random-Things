> - shift pointer right
< - shift pointer left

+ - incrememnt cell
- - decrement cell

. - read to cell
, - write to cell (one character only)
; - literal write (number only) (an inputted 5 will write 5 to the cell)

@ - speed up program time 
_ - slow down program time

[ … ] - if cell at pointer is not 0, run … until cell is 0
    common loop +++[>+++++<-]

= … $ - if cell is 0, run …

Arithmatic
current cell (operator) right of current cell = outputs to current cell

\0-4 - runs a bullshit program

W - controls pointer wrapping

use typesets to change the character set
