Rustype 2.0:

-----Commenting-----

// this is a comment.

Use "//" to define a comment.

-----Creating Variables-----

vdef variable_name = value

Variables are automatiaclly put into the heap where variables cannot be refrenced or modified. Move variables to the callstack to access them.
Variable values that are enclosed in quotation marks ("value") are assumed to be strings. Variables values that are not enclosed in quotation marks will be ran as code, and that output will be used as the value.

-----Moving Variables-----

pull variable_name
push variable_name

Variables can be freely moved between the callstack and the heap using the push and pull keywords. Use pull to move a variable from the heap to the callstack, and use push to move a variable from the callstack to the heap.

-----Logging Variable Values-----
