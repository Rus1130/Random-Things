theres a lot of stuff in the d attribute, I wonder if the first 7 letters mean anything...
once you find the meaning, find the file!
subtract 100 from each letter. Don't forget about unicode. 0123456789
after you do that, you get a bunch of numbers. 0123456789ABCDEF
then make it a color.
w3schools can help you with that.
